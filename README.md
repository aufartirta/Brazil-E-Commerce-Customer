# Customer Behavior Analysis & Segmentation - Brazil E-commerce
## Project Overview

### Objective:
The project aims to identify customer behavior patterns and segment customers to optimize business strategies and enhance customer engagement and retention.

### Data Source:
The analysis is based on the Brazil Olist e-commerce dataset, which provides a comprehensive view of customer orders, payments, delivery times, and product reviews.

### Key Metrics:
* Payment Methods Utilized
* Delivery Times
* Customer Ratings
* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
* Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Analysis

## Key Findings:

1. Predominant Payment Method: The credit card is the most commonly used payment method, accounting for 73.92% of transactions. Boleto, a popular Brazilian cash payment method, follows as the second most utilized payment option.
2. Payment Behavior: Customers tend to break down larger payments into smaller installments, particularly for high-value purchases, indicating a preference for manageable payment options.
3. Transaction Discrepancies: Approximately 59.21% of all transactions show no difference between the total order value and total payment value. However, nearly 40% of transactions exhibit discrepancies, highlighting a need for further investigation.
4. Impact of Delivery Speed: Faster delivery times are generally correlated with higher customer ratings, indicating that timely delivery is crucial for customer satisfaction.
5. Delivery Time Insights: Among the top 10 cities with the most orders, the average delivery time ranges from 7 to 18 days, reflecting variations in logistics and customer expectations.
6. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis: The analysis helped in identifying high-value customers and understanding their purchasing patterns, which can be leveraged for targeted marketing strategies.
7. RFM Analysis: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis was conducted to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, aiding in personalized marketing efforts.

## Conclusions:
1. Payment Preferences: The dominance of credit cards as a payment method suggests that payment options should be optimized to cater to customer preferences, particularly for high-value transactions.
2. Delivery Impact: Timely delivery is essential for maintaining high customer satisfaction, and efforts should be made to reduce delivery times where possible.
3. Investigate Discrepancies: The significant percentage of transactions with discrepancies between order and payment values warrants further investigation to identify and resolve underlying issues.
4. Customer Segmentation: The CLV and RFM analyses provide valuable insights into customer segmentation, enabling more effective targeting and personalized marketing strategies.

## Recommendations:
1. Optimize Payment Options: Consider expanding and enhancing payment options, particularly installment plans, to accommodate customer preferences for larger purchases.
2. Improve Delivery Logistics: Focus on improving delivery times, especially in cities with longer average delivery periods, to enhance customer satisfaction.
3. Investigate Transaction Discrepancies: Conduct a detailed analysis of the transactions with discrepancies to identify patterns and potential issues in the payment processing or order management systems.
4. Leverage Customer Segmentation: Use the insights from CLV and RFM analyses to develop targeted marketing campaigns aimed at retaining high-value customers and re-engaging at-risk segments.
